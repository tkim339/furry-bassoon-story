The girl and her dog sat on top of the hill, looking down on what had been their home town. The trees were replaced with concrete and the once green river had turned a murky gray. She motioned toward her companion and began to make her way down toward the home that she once knew.
She successfully got to the home even if she suffered a lot from the bad smell due to the terrible environment. However, before she opened the door, her dog started to bark loudly and prepared to fight. It seems that there are some huge danger inside her home. 

The door was kicked in easily enough. The girl braced for what came next, but surpirisingly nothing happened. The enterance appeared empty, but her dog was still on edge. The girl slowly entered the house. She waited for the dog to catch up, but it refused to follow. A shiver ran up her spine. She was on her own now.

It was dark inside the house, with no recent signs of life. While looking around, she thought of the many fond memories she once had here. However, all of that was now gone. She made her way through the house cautiously, having no idea what might happen next. She eventually found herself outside of what was once her room. She slowly began to open the door.
